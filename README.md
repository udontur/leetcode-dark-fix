# LeetCode Dark Fix
LeetCode Dark Fix is a userscript that adds dark mode to LeetCode's home page, explore page, and settings page because dark theme is unavailable even when the site's offical dark mode is turned on in these pages.

### To Do
- Home page: Drop downs are still in light mode
- General: Footer spacers are gone
- General: Avoid using CSS generated hashes
